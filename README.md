# Butterworth-IIR-filter-design
Design an IIR lowpass filter with the following parameters:  
1. 3-dB frequency at	omega_c = 0.2*pi  
2. edge of stopband	at omega_s = 0.24*pi  
# 
I used “my_filter” function to return the results of the filter automatically when I changed the parameter N in the main code
